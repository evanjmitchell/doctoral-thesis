# doctoral-thesis
This respository contains all of the Matlab code used in the thesis of Evan Mitchell, entitled "Coevolution of hosts and pathogens in the presence of multiple types of hosts", completed as part of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Western Ontario. All of the code contained in this repository was written by EM.
